Record steps
------------
The following steps will create the Demo1.bin file:
1. BIT90 cold boot
2. BIT90 Load the demo program
3. Connect the audio cables to pc and start Audicity
4. BIT90 Save the demo program as binary:
   BSAVE "DEMO",30720,18432
5. Audacity record the program and save audio as raw PCM 8 bit unsigned to "Demo1.raw"
6. Decode the raw to binary with bit90decode.py Demo1

Note: with the bsave command a binary memory dump is made.
0x7800 - 0x7fff ram memory area that contains pointers and other bit90 state info  
0x8000 - 0xbfff ram memory area where the basic program is stored

PC steps
--------
1. Install Mame, see: https://www.mamedev.org/
2. Download bit90.zip and put it in the mame/roms folder
3. Copy the bit90demo.bat and demoscript.txt to the mame folder
4. Copy the demo1.bin to the mame/roms folder
5. Start bit90demo.bat

Note: 
The current mame 0.247 bit90 machine has no option to load from tape.
The debugger load to memory is therefore used as a workaround.
The memory file must be loaded prior to starting the machine.
