Introduction
------------
To install Mame, see: https://www.mamedev.org/
Download bit90.zip (use google) and put it in the mame/roms folder

The current mame version (0.247) bit90 machine has no tape support yet.
You can however load a decoded program as binary in memory with the debugger.

There are two alternative approaches, as an example the demo.bas program is used.


Alternative 1:
--------------
This is the fastest approach if you already have the program as a binary file.
You load the binary file in the emulated BIT90 memory at address 0x8004.
You call the BIT90 rom routine at 0x30CB (decimal 12491) that sets the memory pointers. 

Detailed steps:
1. Decode the basic program to a binary (see decoding steps in the demo folder)
2. Copy the demo.bin to the mame/roms folder
3. Start mame in debug mode with the following command:
   mame bit90 -debug
4. Boot the machine (F5 or command "go" in the debug window)
5. Load the demo.bin in memory at position 0x8004 with following command in the debugger:
   load roms\demo.bin,8004
6. At the emulated BIT90 command prompt call the routine to set the memory pointers:
   CALL 12491
7. Enjoy with the loaded BIT90 basic program :-)



Alternative 2:
--------------
The alternative approach is to include the BIT90 state ram memory space in the binary file.
Prior to starting the BIT90 machine you load this binary file in the memory with the debugger at address 0x7800.

On the BIT90 you can save the memory to tape with the BSAVE command:
Start address is 30720 (0x7800)
Length is 18432 bytes(2K for the bit90 state and 16K basic program)

0x7800 - 0x7fff = ram memory area that contains pointers and other bit90 state info 
Note: 0x7800 is mapped to the same memory as 0x7000

0x8000 - 0xbfff = ram memory area where the basic program is stored.
 
Detailed steps:
1. Create the Demo1.bin file:
   1a. BIT90 cold boot
   1b. BIT90 Load the demo program
   1c. Connect the audio cables to pc and start Audicity
   1d. BIT90 Save the demo program as binary:
       BSAVE "DEMO",30720,18432
   1e. Audacity record the program and save audio as raw PCM 8 bit unsigned to "Demo1.raw"
   1f. Decode the raw to binary with bit90decode.py Demo1
2. Copy the demo1.bin to the mame/roms folder
3. Start mame in debugger mode with the following command:
   mame bit90 -debug
4. Load the Demo1.bin in memory at position 0x7800 with following command in the debugger:
   load roms\Demo1.bin,7800
5. Boot the machine (F5 or command "go" in the debug window)
6. Enjoy with the loaded BIT90 basic program :-) 
   BIT90 command: RUN

Steps 3 to 5 can be automated:
1. Copy the bit90demo.bat and demoscript.txt to the mame folder
2. Start bit90demo.bat
